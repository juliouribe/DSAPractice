/*
Arrays
Strengths
- get value O(1)
- replace value O(1)
- delete value O(1)

Weakness
- upload all of that memory upfront
- using it can be cumbersome


LinkedList
Strengths
- flexible. Can grow in size
- fast get, delete, add for head/tail

Weakness
- Traversal

Can we have array access with the room to grow?
