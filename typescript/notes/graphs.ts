Matrices

DFS
Good for search in a sequence. Finding a word in a matrix. Finding islands or
the largest island. Looks like it's nice when looking for a sequence. I believe
DFS is more common with matrices.

BFS is nice when we want to find the shortest path or if we are working with
a problem that involves layers.
