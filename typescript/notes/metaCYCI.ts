Goals of a coding interview
- how do you think and tackle hard problems
- how do you consider engineering trade-offs (memory vs time)
- how you communicate in English about technical problems
- find the limits of what you know
    - don't feel bad if you don't get all the answers right

What is covered?
- common problems in algorithms. No puzzle problems

Key things to know about coding interviews
- discuss complexity of space and time trade-offs
- common library functions are fair game
- specific questions about concepts are rare
- when thinking about optimizing time vs space - consider both

Strings
- parsing and processing
Arrays and ArrayLists/Vectors
Queues and Stacks
Maps, Hashmaps, and Sets
Linked Lists
- singly-linked, doubly-linked
- circular
Trees, BSTs, and N-ary trees
- recursion
- DFS vs BFS
- tree traversal
Graphs
- directed vs undirected
- DFS vs BFS
- Adjacency List vs Matrix

Format of a coding interview
- don't worry if the interviewer stops you in the middle of a question. You might
get interrupted even if it looks clear that you are going to solve.
- Might have other follow ups they want to explore.
- be prepared to test your code, discuss how it works, and analyze performance
- phone screens use an online collaborative editor (but don't run any code!)
- time to ask questions. During the Q&A you might want to use that time to figure
out what you want from a career and figure out if Meta feels like a right fit

Steps to a successful coding interview
- repeat the question back to your interviewer to ensure you fully understand
what's being asked. Remember, your questions may be purposefully vague!
- ask questions about edge cases.
- take your time to think about a solution before coding. Don't just jump into coding!
- start coding while explaining your entire though process. It's encouraged to
talk out loud. Don't worry if you run into trouble! Feel free to ask your interviewer
for a hint. Interviewers may also give you hints unprompted, take them and run with them.
- run through your solution with test cases. Continue talking out loud.
- iterate - how can you do better with runtime/memory?



Other Notes
- we won't run the code. Think about how you would test your code.
- focus on solving problems. Spitting out a class is most likely not the focus.


More tips
- keep your intro short
- repeat the question back to your interviewer before proceeding. Run through a
couple of sample inputs and expected outputs.
- It's okay to ask for a hint if you are stuck. Time is scarce
- ask for permission to use a built in function or data structure.
- you will not run any code but are expected to be able to walk through your code
step by step
- consider edge cases and ways to improve your code towards the end.
- also be sure to mention time and space complexity
